# Animal Multi-classification

This project uses 3 datasets to do 3 tasks:
* Stage 1: classification of animal classes - to predict that the target is a mammal or bird
* Stage 2: classification of species - to predict that the target is a rabbit, rat or chick
* Stage 3: multi-classification - to predict the class and the species at the same time

### 1. Structure of project
A. Datasets
    * Structure of dataset: number of images
      * train
        * chicken: 310
        * rabbits: 310
        * rats: 270
        
      * val
        * chicken: 30
        * rabbits: 30
        * rats: 20
        
    * Images-rename.py: rename images in bulk
    
A. Stage_1 Classes_classification
    * Classes_make_anno.py: generate annotations for train and test dataset; choose rabbits and chicken as datasets and predict whether the image shows a mammal or bird

    * Classes_Network.py: network for classes classification

    * Classes_classification.py: main file for training model and evaluation and calling trained model to do prediction

    * Classes_train_annotation.csv/Classes_val_annotation.csv: annotations for classes classification (generated by Classes_make_anno.py)
