## Question

### Description
A person is swimming across several rivers.  

Speeds of those rivers are different: ___v1, v2, ..., vn___. To simplify this problem, only consider the speed in vertical direction.  

The person's swimming speed is a constant ___v___. The angle of the person's velocity to ho horizontal line is ___a1, a2, ..., an___.  

The total time for swimming is T. And the person must pass those rivers.

### Task
Find out an equation to determine by choosing what angles (___a1, a2, ..., an___) the person can get maxmimum distance in vertical direction. That is to say, please maximize ___dh___ by determine ___a1, a2, ..., an___) under the total time T.  

You are not required to give out concrete angle numbers, a ___cost function___ that can be derived from is enough.  

Tips: A mathematical tool you may need is called ___Lagrangian Multiplier___, which means, when you provide a formula, say ___E___, which still need to satisfy some more conditions, say ___a>1___, for the convenience of calculating, we can write those 2 parts (formula ___E___ and condition ___a>1___) together as one new formula. Here the new formula will be:
> ___E - lambda(a - 1)___
